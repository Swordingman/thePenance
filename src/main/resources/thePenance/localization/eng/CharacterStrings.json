      "A former municipal judge from Siracusa, burdened by the shadows of the past and the weight of the law. NL She seeks not vengeance, but justice. NL Navigating a path of thorns, she enforces order where none exists.",
      " NL The verdict is delivered. NL Even this Heart, the source of the Spire's corruption, must pay for its sins before the law. NL Your trial has ended, but this is not the end—merely a necessary step towards a new order.",
      "Navigating an unlit street, you come across several hooded figures in the midst of some dark ritual. As you approach, they turn to you in eerie unison. The tallest among them bares fanged teeth and extends a long, pale hand towards you. NL ~\"Join~ ~us,~ ~stern~ ~judge...~ ~lay~ ~down~ ~your~ ~gavel,~ ~and~ ~feel~ ~the~ ~warmth~ ~of~ ~the~ ~Spire.\"~"
