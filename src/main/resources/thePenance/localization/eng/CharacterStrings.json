      "A judge from Syracusa, bearing the shadows of the past and the weight of the law. NL Since the law cannot reach this Spire, she becomes the embodiment of order, cutting through thorns to defend the path.",
      " NL The verdict is delivered. NL Even this Heart—the source of the Spire's sin—must pay the price before the law. NL Your trial is over, but this is not the end; it is the necessary path toward a new order.",
      "Navigating the dim streets, you stumble upon several hooded figures performing a dark ritual. As you approach, they turn toward you in unison, the atmosphere turning eerie. NL The tallest among them reveals fangs and extends a pale hand toward you: NL ~\"Join~ ~us,~ ~rigid~ ~judge...~ ~Cast~ ~aside~ ~that~ ~heavy~ ~gavel,~ ~and~ ~come~ ~feel~ ~the~ ~warmth~ ~of~ ~the~ ~Spire.\"~"
